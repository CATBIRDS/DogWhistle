# DogWhistle

This is the source code repository for **DogWhistle**.

**DogWhistle** is a mod for *Warhammer 40,000: Darktide*, which provides target filtration and automation for the game's enemy tagging system. It was primarily created for the introduction of the [Arbites Class](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710910/Warhammer_40000_Darktide__Arbites_Class/) and their canine companion (hence the name), though it has been extended to provide feature functionality to all classes.
